# Manual One-Hot coding
# Convert Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zr, Mo, Sn, W, CP columns to Boolean values

# CM_type column
    # 0. NoCP
    # means pure MS2
    # 1. CNF
    # includes CNF and CC.
    # 2. CNT
    # includes CNT and MWCNT.
    # 3. G-based
    # includes Graphene, GO and RGO.
    # 4. derived carbon-based
    # such carbon is obtained by carbonization of organic precursors.

# CM_morph column
    # 0. NoCP
    # means pure MS2
    # 1. 0D
    # includes 0D QDs.
    # 2. 1D fibers.
    # includes 1D fibers.
    # 3. 1D tubes
    # includes 1D tubes.
    # 4. 2D
    # includes 2D nanosheets (few layers, thick < 10 nm).
    # 5. 3D porous
    # includes 3D porous and 3D networks.
    # 6. 3D special
    # includes nanoparticles, nanospheres, rods, tubes and flower-like.

# MS2_morph column
    # 0. bulk
    # no regular shape.
    # 1. nanosheets
    # flake，not few-layer sheet.
    # 2. flower-like clusters
    # aggregated from few-layer nanosheets.
    # 3. irregular nanoparticles
    # particles less than 1 μm in size, but the size and dispersion degree are not uniform.
    # 4. nanoparticles
    # includes nanoparticles, octahedron, cubes, rods and spheres. 
    # the size and dispersion are uniform.
    # 5. hollow morph
    # includes hollow spheres, hollow rods, hollow cubes, hollow nanoparticles,
    # double shell spheres, yolk-shell spheres and core-shell nanoparticles. 

# Because the classification feature will be One-Hot encoded later, 
# need to replace the 0 in the classification feature with the 'NoCP' placeholder
# CM_type, CM_morph, CP_morph columns replace all '0' with 'NoCP'
